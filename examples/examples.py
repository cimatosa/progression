    How to use the progression package will be demonstrated in the following examples. If you are solely interested
    usage it should suffice to go through the following. If you are searching for the actual doc
    look :doc:`here </progression>`.

    The function to monitor
    -----------------------

    Let's use ``factorial`` as an example function.

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: factorial

    Any function that is supposed to be monitored by one of the classes of the progression package
    needs to have at least one argument that serves as a counter (for ``factorial`` denoted by ``c``). It needs to be a
    `sharedctype <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.sharedctypes>`_
    because one the one hand ``factorial`` is going to change its value according to its state
    and the progress class (which runs in a subprocess) needs to access this value. For convenience progression
    provides :py:func:`progression.progress.UnsignedIntValue` which instantiates a shared unsigned int with value 0.

    ProgressBar
    -----------

    Let's use :py:class:`.progress.ProgressBar` to monitor the calculation.

    In general the following steps are necessary:

        1) setup the shared value for the counter

        2) create a ProgressBar

             * count: the shared counter
             * max_count: the maximum value counter will reach
             * interval: the refresh interval in seconds

           using the `context manager <https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html>`_ ensures
           that everything gets shutdown on exit

        3) start the ProgressBar via ``start()``

        4) trigger the calculation where ``c`` is passed to the calculating function

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: run_example_ProgressBar

    The output will look like this (here without colors):

    .. code-block:: none

        2.41s [39078.4c/s] [=================>                    ] TTG 3.00s

          ^            ^                                                ^
        elapsed time   speed estimation in counts per second       time to go


    ProgressBarFancy
    ----------------

    Now we use :py:class:`.ProgressBarFancy` which provides
    slightly more information.

    Further the example shows how to use a shared type for
    the maximum value of counter, which allows to set max_count
    after the ProgressPar has started, even by the calculating function.

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: run_example_ProgressBarFancy

    The output reads something like this:

    .. code-block:: none

        [TET-2s-[42877.4c/s]-TTG-3s--> 43.0%  ETA 20161008_14:04:31 ORT 5s]

        TET: total elapsed time
        TTG: time to go
        ETA: estimated time of arrival
        ORT: estimated overall running time

    ProgressBar Decorator
    ---------------------

    To quickly add a ProgressBar to an existing function the decorators from the :doc:`/decorators` ease things.

    Modification of the original ``factorial`` function as follows

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: factorial_dec

    and decorating this function with
    ::

        @pr.decorators.ProgressBar

    allows for a call as in the unmonitored case
    ::

        factorial_dec(N = 200000)

    resulting in the following output

    .. code-block:: none

        factorial_dec 1.01s [61584.8c/s] [=====>    ] TTG 3.00s

    ProgressBar with no max_count value
    -----------------------------------

    When the ``max_count`` argument of the ProgressBar is ``None``
    only the elapsed time, the current speed and the value of count
    will be shown.

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: run_example_max_count_is_none

    .. code-block:: none

        2.47s [38535.8c/s] #95000


    ProgressBarCounter
    ------------------

    Suppose we want to let a time consuming function run several times
    for example with different parameters. Then the :py:class:`.ProgressBarCounter`
    class counts the individual runs and estimates the speed concerning the runs. Everything on top of
    the usual monitoring.

    For doing so choose :py:class:`.ProgressBarCounter` or :py:class:`.ProgressBarFancyCounter` and trigger ``reset()`` every time
    the functions returns.

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: run_example_ProgressBarCounter

    .. code-block:: none

        7.76s [20.0c/min] #2 - 1.75s [3.4c/s] [========>       ] TTG 2.00s
          ^       ^        ^      ^       ^                            ^
          1       2        3      4       5                            6

        1) total elapsed time
        2) speed of the 'resets'
        3) number of 'resets'
        4) elapsed time of current run
        5) speed of the current run
        6) time to go for the current run

    A multi ProgressBarFancy
    ------------------------

    When monitoring several processes in parallel simply replace
    count and max_count by lists of sharedctypes.

    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/examples.py
        :pyobject: run_example_ProgressBarFancy_multi


    .. code-block:: none

        _1_:[E-589.07ms----[20.1c/s]-G-1.00s        44.0%         O 1.59s]
        _2_:[E-906.49ms----[19.7c/s]-G-1.00s--------68.0%>        O 1.91s]
        _3_:[E-947.64ms----[20.0c/s]-G-1.00s--------76.0%------>  O 1.95s]
        _4_:[E-160.46ms--->[31.2c/s] G 1.00s        20.0%         O 1.16s]

    ProgressBar and IPython notebook
    --------------------------------

    Running any kind of ProgressBar in an IPython notebook will result in new lines
    for each status message as moving the cursor is not supported. This problem can
    be circumvented by selecting a special PipeHandler.
    ::

        progression.choose_pipe_handler('ipythonhtml')

    Doing so will forward the output from ProgressBar (any subclass of :py:class:`.Loop`) to an
    `ipywidget HTML object <http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html#HTML>`_.
    Such an object will be created and displayed whenever a ProgressBar gets started. The terminal style and coloring
    is converted to pure HTML.

    .. raw:: html

        <div class="widget-html">
        <style>.widget-html{font-family:monospace}</style>
